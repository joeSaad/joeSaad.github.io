#Favorite Software Tools

This post, I'm planning to write about the list useful tools developers can make use off. They can reduce your development time, some of which are very efficient to learn, experiment, learn and share. Here's my first draft:

##Mere Development
###Sublimetext:
Even though I have tried many other tools and editors, still I find Sublime to be the most performant and allowing one to do many things at the same time. 

###JSfiddle: 
Developing on a browser, makes it the quickest way for you to try Javascripts and CSS/Scss/Sass without having to develop on your desktop. Especially with the ES6 now is out, one would need trying syntaxes and learning right from the browser. It has a run button so you changes reflect only after you finish editing which is a plus at many times especially when writing some kind of loops. 

###codepen.io
This one has been really popular especially if you want to learn CSS/SCSS/SASS tricks and others. Being popular and has support for many great tools. I love using it with react though you need to include some special script to have it work with react. It also reflects your changes on the fly without having to click any run button. Sometimes this maybe annoying but still quick and responsive to all your changes. One extra point for this one as well is its has a console panel so you won't have to use the your browsers one, which is much cleaner as you can see only your pen's changes on it. 

###Livestyle
Here's a plugin you could easily get addicted to. You create a page, or wait a minute, you can just visit any page online, add your Stylesheets onto it from your hard drive, edit the CSS/SCSS on the browser to see it actually got edited on the file itself. 

###ColorPick EyeDropper
Any designer and frontend developer would need this chrome plugin, it provides the hex number for any color you have on the page. I am thinking the creators should apply a convertor to that to provide rgba color as well rather than changing it yourself.

###MeasureIt
This plugin any designer will definitely find useful. I don't know how much this will fit within the RWD and adaptive design for newer devices. But it helps knowing the dimensions of each object you have a page. Unfortunately, the tool has some error in the console but it still works and makes things easy, so why not. Hopefully the creators should put a fix for that. 

###Regex Tester App 
Here is a quick plugin that helped me a lot testing my regex before actually using them within my code. Very handy, light weight and user-friendly. 

###CORS 
Another Chrome plugin that would allow you to make REST calls to other services without having to face the message of "Cross Origin error...". Notice this is only for mere development, you will have to change your code for real calls if you want your code published correctly and work without errors for users. Also, this application will stop all other normal sites from working properly such as twitter or youtube only if it switched on. So if you want to use other useful sites after that make sure to switch it off before happily browsing the rest of the web. 

###Chrome UA Spoofer
With all the device testing needed for each site and page you're developing, this plugin helps view your page in a good number of devices and browser sizes. 

###Waves
Developers and development environments should forget about accessibility of their code. Your code should deliver a product that is accessible for those challenged in various ways. This plugin runs over your code and shows where your code is breaking if it didn't pass according to the Section 508 standards. 

###DiffEnvs
I have created this tool a while back also, for those developers, testers and content-editors working on different environments all the time; development, staging and production. Environments get confusing and you so many times miss reading which URL you're at and start editing production missing that you are actually in development. This tool helps with the differentiation of those tools by imposing a background color to help differentiate which environment you are at. You can also configure it as you want. Check it out and comments are welcomed. 

##Data
###JSON Prettifier
A great tool to make your JSON look cleaner and allow you to see what is broken with it. 

###Mockaroo
Wish I had known this tool much earlier in my development days. If you don't know this tool, you are really missing out. You are testing with data of different types all the time. This online tool give a quick mock of different data types with as much quantity as you want. Thumbs up to the creators. 


##Security
###1Password
With writing a new password with different criteria for each site you work on, this tool comes in as the most handy. I compared it to others and think it's reasonable in price and definitely worth it. You just need that tool that'll have all your password for each site stored for you and easily accessed and detected each time you reach that site. 

##Blogging and Sharing 
###Stackedit 
I love this one for writing your markdowns. Accurate and not as buggy and some I have found online. You may need to do your own research if you need extra features. There are a lot of those out there especially the markdown coming more and more popular. 

###TweetALink
A chrome extension I have created a couple of years ago, that would allow you to share any page you are one with just one click. Pretty handy as it shortens your URLs for your and you don't have to look for the Share on Tweeter button which in many cases isn't existent on many useful articles you view online.

###Native Url Shortner
This is a chrome plugin that would shorten any URL of any page you are visiting which would allow you share it easily afterwards.

##Organization
###Evernote
Since day one, I found this cloud-based tool to be very fitting to my writing needs. Accessing your notes from any device hasn't easier. 

###Todist
Among all the todo tools I settled on this one. It has really cool features but I am sure there are many out there that are as good and improving and providing more features.
